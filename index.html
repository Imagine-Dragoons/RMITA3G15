								<h2>About Ryan</h2>
								<p>I was born in New Zealand and spent most of my childhood living in Invercargill. When I was 15 I moved to the Sunshine Coast and completed the last 2 years of school with the same Benjamin that is part of this team. From here I completed first year Auto Electrical at Tafe and then went on to work for about 5 years in the same trade. Prompted by a lull in the industry I moved down to a small country town North West of Ipswich call Lowood. I spent the next 10 years as a Traffic controller in the construction industry, until I followed my heart and landed my current Job at Apple inc. I have been with Apple for almost 5 years and would like to move in to software devlopment.</p>

								<h2>About Benjamin</h2>
								<p>I spent most of my growing up split between the mountain ranges of the Dandenongs in Victoria and then the canals and beaches of The Sunshine Coast in Queensland. I’ve had various jobs out of school and then completed an Auto Refinishing apprenticeship which eventually lead me to my current employment as an aircraft painter for the RAAF. For may years I enjoyed a hobby of DJ’ing mostly at small niteclubs, private parties and many weddings. I’ve since hung up the headphones to pursue other IT related interests.</p>

								<h2>About Douglas</h2>
								<p>I grew up on the Northern Beaches of Sydney, and moved to Dubbo in Central Western NSW about 15 years ago. While I am approaching 20 years in the IT industry, I have not sat down and acheived formal qualifications. My IT roles have changed from Sales through to being a hardware tech, working in Managed Service Providers, and now as a Systems and Network Engineer for a large not for profit organization.</p>

								<h2>About Ty</h2>
								<p>Hi, my name is Ty Lynch and I'm a first-generation Australian. My parents were both born in England, both my mother and father moved over when they were young with their parents. My parents first met in Canberra, where I was born and when I was around 2 we moved to Bendigo, Victoria. I grew up and went to school in Bendigo until I turned 16 and then moved to Adelaide. I finished my schooling and started looking for work, at that time I didn't think university was for me. I found an electrical apprenticeship through an apprentice agency which was great as it allowed me to develop a wide range of new skillsets and experiences. I completed my apprenticeship at the end of 2018 and have been working as a qualified electrician ever since. I currently have a pet bearded dragon named Spyro after the cult classic PlayStation game.</p>
